/**
 * @fileoverview
 * Complements to generators (see generators.js) that filter out dates which
 * do not match some criteria.
 *
 * The generators are stateful objects that generate candidate dates, and
 * filters are stateless predicates that accept or reject candidate dates.
 *
 * An example of a filter is the BYDAY in the rule below
 *   RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=13;BYDAY=FR   # Every Friday the 13th
 *
 * The BYMONTHDAY generator generates the 13th of the month, and a BYDAY
 * filter rejects any that are not Fridays.
 *
 * This could be done the other way -- a BYDAY generator could generate all
 * Fridays which could then be rejected if they were not the 13th day of the
 * month, but rrule.js chooses generators so as to minimize the number of
 * candidates.
 *
 * Filters are represented as pure functions from dateValues to booleans.
