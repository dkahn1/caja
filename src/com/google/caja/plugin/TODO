* Decide what to do about javascript URLs.  Should we extract the way
   we do handler attributes, or reject.
* i18n for GxpCompiler.  Implement gxp:msg.
* Warn on missing ids or classes in the GXP not present in the CSS or
  vice versa.  For the former, possibly limit to those within a
  certain edit distance of ones defined.
* Post compiler checks -- no comments or non-latin chars in output
  source.  No control characters in markup since chars 0-8 not allowed
  in XML at all, not even escaped.
  Other inexpensive assertions?
