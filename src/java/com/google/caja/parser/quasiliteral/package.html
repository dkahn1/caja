Quasiliterals for matching and transforming Javascript parse trees.

<dt>Exophoric Functions</dt>
  <dd>A function where {@code this} can be bound to any instance.  Contrast
  to a method, where {@code this} can only be an instance of the method's
  class.
  <p>
  In javascript, all methods are really exophoric functions, but Caja
  distinguishes between methods and exophoric functions since methods
  have access to an instance's private API via {@code this}.
  An exophoric function references {@code this} but never uses it in a way
  that would access the private API.
  <p>
  See <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-caja/wiki/FunctionSpecies">
  FunctionSpecies</a> for types of functions.

    Quasiliterals can be used to match patterns in parse trees and
    produce parse trees as output.<pre>
match("@clazz.prototype.@methodName = function (@params*) { @body*; }",
      node, bindings, scope)
</pre>
    will check whether node looks like a javascript method assignment,
    and if successful, will put entries into {@code bindings} that map
    "quasi-holes" like {@code "clazz"} to the corresponding
    descendents of node.

    <p>Quasiliterals can also be used to generate parse trees as in<pre>
substV("caja.def(@clazz, @baseClazz, @methods, @statics)",
       "clazz", ..., "baseClazz", ..., "methods", ..., "statics", ...);
</pre>
