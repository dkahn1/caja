<title>Caja Calendar Demo</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A demo application that extracts
<a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar">&mu;formatted calendar data</a>
from a read only DOM and displays it on a calendar widget.

<p>This is meant to let us test different optimization strategies.

<p>It consists of several pieces:
<dl>
<dt>hcalendar extractor
<dd>walks a DOM to extracts calendar data generating an RFC 2445 VCALENDAR.
Will test the performance of our tamed DOM.

<dt>calendrical calculations.
<dd>Will test the performance of cajoled code by doing some algorithmic work
involving lots of primitive operations and method calls.

<dt>calendar grid
<dd>displays a set of events.
Will test HTML rendering and sanitization.
</dl>

<h2>Calendrical Calculations</h2>

<p>A javascript port of {@link
http://code.google.com/p/google-rfc-2445/}.  The main entry point is
<code>rrule-cajita.js</code> which provides an interpreter for RRULEs
and EXRULEs.

<p><code>time-cajita.js</code> includes a date implementation that
will let us test operations on primitives, give us the opportunity to
test which numeric operations can be proven safe, and try out
inlining.

<p>This is written in Cajita and should help in profiling the
javascript cajita translator.

<p>There are a number of supporting files,
<code>generators-cajita.js</code>, <code>filters-cajita.js</code>, and
<code>conditions-cajita.js</code> all represent different rule parts
in RFC 2445 RRULEs.</p>

<p>There is a primitive timezone implementation in
<code>timezone-cajita.js</code>.
