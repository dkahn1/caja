<title>Caja Calendar Demo</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>A demo application that extracts
<a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar">&mu;formatted calendar data</a>
from a read only DOM and displays it on a calendar widget.

<p>This is meant to let us test different optimization strategies.

<p>It consists of several pieces:
<dl>
<dt>hcalendar extractor
<dd>walks a DOM to extracts calendar data generating an RFC 2445 VCALENDAR.
Will test the performance of our tamed DOM.

<dt>calendrical calculations.
<dd>Will test the performance of cajoled code by doing some algorithmic work
involving lots of primitive operations and method calls.

<dt>layout
<dd>Defines a mapping between date ranges and pairs of grid cells, uses that
to break events into "Chips" (graphical representations of part of an event on
screen), and defines algorithms to minimize overlap between Chips by shrinking
them along their minor axis.

<dt>calendar grid
<dd>displays a set of events.
Will test HTML rendering and sanitization.
</dl>

<h2>Calendrical Calculations</h2>

<p>A javascript port of {@link
http://code.google.com/p/google-rfc-2445/}.  The main entry point is
<code>rrule-cajita.js</code> which provides an interpreter for RRULEs
and EXRULEs.

<p><code>time-cajita.js</code> includes a date implementation that
will let us test operations on primitives, give us the opportunity to
test which numeric operations can be proven safe, and try out
inlining.

<p>This is written in Cajita and should help in profiling the
javascript cajita translator.

<p>There are a number of supporting files,
<code>generators-cajita.js</code>, <code>filters-cajita.js</code>, and
<code>conditions-cajita.js</code> all represent different rule parts
in RFC 2445 RRULEs.</p>

<p>There is a primitive timezone implementation in
<code>timezone-cajita.js</code>.


<h2>Layout</h2>
<p><code>layout-policy.js</code> defines the mapping between date ranges
and pairs of grid cells.  <code>layout.js</code> uses that to break
events (defined in <code>event.js</code> into chips
see <code>chip.js</code>).</p>

<p>Finally <code>overlap.js</code> takes a group of Chips, and minimizes
overlap between them.  It makes extensive use of <code>bitset.js</code>
which is another good candidate for optimization.</p>
