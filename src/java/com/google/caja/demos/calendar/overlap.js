 * Functions for rearranging overlapping rectangles.

/**
 * Rearranges overlapping rectangles so that they do not overlap by
 * shrinking them along their minor axis.
 *
 * <h3>Input</h3>
 * <p>We have a bunch of rectangles laid out on a 2-D page, and we he have a
 * major axis and a minor axis, so rectangles either left to right,
 * top to bottom, as in the Roman alphabet (majorAxis:Y);
 * or top to bottom, left to right, as in traditional Chinese (majorAxis:X).
 * The reading order corresponds to time-order when talking about events.
 * Week view is laid out as per Chinese reading order, and month view follows
 * Roman.
 *
 * <p>The goal is an arrangement of rectangles where no rectangles overlap,
 * the output rectangles span the same range in their minor axis, and a subset
 * of their range along the major axis.</p>
 *
 *
 * <h3>Assumptions</h3>
 * <p>The rectangles are already divided into disjoint regions along the
 * major axis, so there are no rectangles R1 and R2 such that R1 and R2 do
 * not have the same span along the major, and R1's and R2's spans intersect.
 * </p>
 *
 *
 * <h3>Algorithm</h3>
 * <p>This is achieved by the following algorithm which orders rectangles,
 * iteratively finds the minimum set of rectangles where each rectangle only
 * overlaps with others in the set, and then divides up the major axis so that
 * no rectangles overlaps others.</p>
 * <ol>
 *
 * <li>First we sort rectangles in reading order (see Roman/Chinese above).
 * <br>The sort is stable so that, below, earlier occuring items with the same
 * position in reading order receive the first slots making them more likely
 * to escape culling.
 *
 * <li>Until we've checked all rectangles
 *   <ol>
 *   <li>Pick the first rectangle in order that hasn't been resolved
 *
 *   <li>Add that to the set of rectangles to resolve.
 *
 *   <li>Walk from that point in the list of rectangles forward, adding
 *   rectangles until we encounter one that doesn't intersect any rectangle
 *   in the set.
 *
 *   <br>This is efficient because we know that we're traversing rectangles in
 *   "reading order", and that the rectangles are in disjoint "columns" along
 *   the minor axis.  These two assumptions mean that it's trivial to come up
 *   with a bounding box for the region which is the minor axis min of the
 *   first item added to the minor axis max of all elements in the set.
 *
 *   <li>Now that we know the set of overlapping rectangles, we can assign
 *   each rectangle to a subset of its "column", its span along the major
 *   axis.
 *
 *   <br>For each rectangle R in the overlapping set, ordered by reading order
 *     <ol>
 *     <li>If there are rectangles in slots that don't overlap R, mark their
 *     slot free.
 *     <li>Assign R to the first free slot, creating one if necessary
 *     <li>Mark the slot busy
 *     </ol>
 *
 *   <li>We now have an initial slot assignment, but there may be wasted
 *   space, as in the case
 *   <blockquote><pre>
 *   A B C
 *   A B C
 *       C
 *   D   C</pre><small><i>major axis is x</i></small></blockquote>
 *   D could expand to occupy two slots, using more of the available space.
 *
 *   <br>We again walk the list of overlapping rectangles, keeping track of
 *   free-slots in the same way as above, but for each slot, we also keep
 *   track of the position where it was last occupied so that we can tell when
 *   assigning a slot whether or not it could span slots to the right/down.
 *   <br>For each rectangle R in the overlapping set, ordered by reading order
 *     <ol>
 *     <li>If there are rectangles in slots that don't overlap R, mark their
 *     slot free, and store their endpoint (minor-axis max) in extent[slot].
 *     <li>If R was assigned slot S, assign it the end slot T, and mark S
 *     occupied.
 *     <li>Greedily expand into slots where there is space available.
 *     <tt>while (T < num_slots && free[T] && extent[T] < R's minor-axis min)
 *       T +=1</tt>
 *     </ol>
 *   This does not guarantee the maximum area covered, but is a good
 *   approximation in practice.
 *
 *   <li>Finally, we divvy the "column" into equally wide "sub-columns", and
 *   update each rectangles major axis bounds to span its slots.
 * </ol>
 *
 *
 * <h3>Output</h3>
 * <p>Since a rectangle may span multiple columns, the assumptions on input
 * do not apply to the output.</p>
 *
 *
 * @param {Array.<Rect>} rects objects with x, y, w, h attributes.  Modified
 *   in place.  x and y are upper left corners, while w and h are width and
 *   height respectively.  The rects must occupy discrete columns.
 * @param majorAxis the most significant axis along which time progresses.
 *   In week view, time progresses by hour along the y and days along the x,
 *   so x is the majorAxis.
 * @param {number} numReserved the number of reserved slots
 * @param {boolean} fixedSlotSize should chips be allowed to occupy more than
 *   1 slot?
