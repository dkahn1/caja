(with temporary fix for issue 911)


ajax_test: 18 tests, 16 assertions, 10 failures, 8 errors

	Heavily reliant on as yet unimplemented TameXMLHTTPRequest().


array_test: 20 tests, 93 assertions, 5 failures, 0 errors
	    20 tests, 98 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors


base_test: 35 tests, 208 assertions, 0 failures, 2 errors

dollar_test: 2 tests, 4 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors


dom_test: 92 tests, 229 assertions, 34 failures, 42 errors


element_mixins_test: 4 tests, 11 assertions, 0 failures, 2 errors

  testEvent

	Fails because attributes can't be set on tame nodes.

  testCollections

	Fails. Reason not yet determined.


enumerable_test: 25 tests, 83 assertions, 0 failures, 1 errors

  testEnumContext

	Fails because it tries to compare to nonexistent this.min and
	so throws. I believe it would also fail uncajoled, but not
	tested. Mysteriously fixed by #911 fix!

  testGrep

	Fails because it uses selector.js:Selector.initialize(), which
	uses eval() because neither XPath (document.evaluate()) nor
	Selectors API (document.querySelector()) are available. It may
	be possible to make the default scheme
	(selector.js:Select.compileMatcher()) work without eval(),
	too.


event_test:

	Doesn't start.
