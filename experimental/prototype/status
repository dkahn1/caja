(with temporary fix for issue 911)


ajax_test: 18 tests, 15 assertions, 11 failures, 8 errors

	Heavily reliant on as yet unimplemented TameXMLHTTPRequest().


array_test: 20 tests, 98 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors


base_test: 35 tests, 209 assertions, 0 failures, 1 errors

dollar_test: 2 tests, 4 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors


dom_test: 92 tests, 232 assertions, 53 failures, 40 errors
	  92 tests, 229 assertions, 34 failures, 42 errors

        Increase seems to be caused by shadowing and styles not mixing
        well.


element_mixins_test: 4 tests, 11 assertions, 0 failures, 1 errors

  testCollections

	Fails. Reason not yet determined.


enumerable_test: 25 tests, 83 assertions, 0 failures, 1 errors

  testGrep

	Fails because it uses selector.js:Selector.initialize(), which
	uses eval() because neither XPath (document.evaluate()) nor
	Selectors API (document.querySelector()) are available. It may
	be possible to make the default scheme
	(selector.js:Select.compileMatcher()) work without eval(),
	too.


event_test: 15 tests, 13 assertions, 1 failures, 12 errors


form_test: 15 tests, 0 assertions, 0 failures, 15 errors

	 Every test uses eval.
