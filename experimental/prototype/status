	Heavily reliant on as yet unimplemented TameXMLHTTPRequest().
        To run this test properly, we will need the test to run from
        the Rakefile using the WEBrick HTTP server. Currently, this
        cannot be done for cajoled tests. Tobie is going to make that
        possible asap.

	Without the HTTP server, the only difference is
	testIsSameOriginMethod.

  testGet

	Fails because $H({}}.get('toString') is expected to be
	undefined, but instead is bound to a function.

  testPreventIterationOverShadowedProperties

	Fails twice because the object's constructor appears in
	Hash(obj).toQueryString().
