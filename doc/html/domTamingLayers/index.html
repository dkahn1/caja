<!-- ############################################################ -->

<h1>Summary</h1>

<p>This is a description of our layered scheme for taming the browser
DOM for the Caja system.</p>

<!-- ############################################################ -->

<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>The following shows the relationship of the layers:</p>

<div class="figure"><img src="layers.png"/></div>

<h2>Native browser DOM</h2>

<p>This is the multitude of browser DOM implementations with their
various quirks.</p>

<h2>BRIDAL suite</h2>

<p>The <strong>BR</strong>owser <strong>I</strong>ndependent
<strong>D</strong>OM <strong>A</strong>bstraction
<strong>L</strong>ayer is a set of utilities for unifying browser
quirks. It is not a complete abstraction but rather a bunch of utility
functions plus a set of recommendations about when to use them in
order to avoid browser incompatibilities. As such, it is a helper
library for "expert" use.</p>

<p>For example, BRIDAL would include a recommendation to the
programmer to use the <code>bridalAddEventListener</code> function to
add an event listener to a DOM node, rather than using native DOM
methods. BRIDAL, in turn, would call <code>Element::attachEvent</code>
on IE and <code>Element::addEventListener</code> on other browsers
based on feature testing.</p>

<h2>Secure DOM interface</h2>

<p>The secure DOM interface is designed to be a DOM interface
compatible with capability discipline that, within that constraint,
does not vary <em>gratuitously</em> from the W3C standard.</p>

<p>For example, the W3C interface provides a
<code>Node::getParent</code> method that allows the caller to traverse
as far as they wish <em>up</em> the DOM tree. We deem this unsafe
since we want to be able to confine programs to only that subtree of
the DOM they have been given, so we do not support
<code>getParent</code>. Instead, we define a new method, which is not
part of the W3C interface, called:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">Node::getParentInTree(treeRoot)</pre>

<p>where, in this situation:</p>

<div class="figure"><img src="safeGetParent.png"/></div>

<p><code>c.getParentInTree(a) === b</code> and
<code>c.getParentInTree(d)</code> throws an exception. In other words,
the caller must demonstrate, by passing <code>treeRoot</code>, that
they have authority over the tree containing the parent of some node
before they are allowed to see its parent.</p>

<h2>Domita layer</h2>

<p>This is a taming of the browser DOM, with the help of BRIDAL, to
conform to the Secure DOM interface. This is likely to be a complete
proxy layer: for each native DOM node exposed to the client, there
will be a Domita proxy object.</p>

<p>We will build this starting from <code>domita.js</code> as defined
at time of writing. However, we have two implementation techniques we
need to investigate as time permits:</p>

<ol>

  <li><p>Declarative membrane generation to construct and manage the
  proxies, as started by Caja intern Adrienne Felt during the summer
  of 2008.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>Writing as much as possible of the Domita layer in Cajita,
  rather than native JavaScript, so as to get the language to help us
  achieve security.</p></li>
  
</ol>

<h2>W3C DOM interface</h2>

<p>This is simply the standard <a href="http://www.w3.org/DOM/">W3C
DOM specification</a>.</p>

<h2>Dom&oacute;tico layer</h2>

<p>This is a layer that allows Valija clients to perceive that they
have a full W3C DOM, but subject to container restrictions. For
example, a container may define the context of a group of Valija
module to contain a reference to a shared parent node:</p>

<div class="figure"><img src="pluginRoot.png"></div>

<p>In this layer, <code>Node::getParent</code> is re-implemented to
use a Valija global variable provided by the container to a group of
modules:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint">
function getParent() {
  try {
    return self.getParentInTree($v.ro('rootNode'));
  } catch (e) {
    return null;
  }
}
</pre>

<p>The container is responsible for ensuring that
<code>$v.ro('rootNode')</code> points to a suitable root node serving
as the "virtual top-level document" that the Valija code
perceives.</p>
