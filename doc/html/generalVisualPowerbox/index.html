<h1>A General Visual Powerbox</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We describe the boundaries of a general visual (drag and drop
oriented) powerbox for a hypothetical object oriented software system
with capability security and an object oriented user interface. We
then summarize the open questions regarding how such a powerbox may
behave.</p>

<h2>Problem description</h2>

the "drag something onto a map" problem.</div>

<p>We present a hypothetical "mashup" application allowing the user to
visualize the geographic location associated with any object that
contains that information.</p>

<h3>Base condition</h3>

<p>The user starts with a stationery drawer that has "kinds of things"
they may instantiate. They can use that affordance to create any
number of maps; we show two in the diagram. Each map instance is
completely isolated from any other.</p>

<p>A user drags and drops arbitrary objects onto the map in order to
visualize and keep track of their location. Dragging an object onto
the map authorizes the map, by designation, to maintain a reference to
that object in some way that the map can obtain the latitude and
longitude (and, hopefully, nothing else).</p>

<h3>Complication 1: Tile server</h3>

<p>Our map allows panning and zooming to a fine level of detail.  We
cannot reasonably expect the map application to include, as immutable
static state compiled into the code, all the terrain images from all
the world. Hence the map must be able to load, at run time, "tile"
images at varying resolutions for display.</p>

<h3>Complication 2: Popup details view</h3>

<p>When the user moves the mouse pointer over a mapped object, the map
is expected, with the help of the object displayed, to display a small
popup view describing that object. For example, if the user mapped an
item from their contacts list (as shown above) then moved the mouse
pointer over it, the map would show a "business card" view with some
basic information.</p>

<h3>Complication 3: Event exchange</h3>

<p>When an object is dragged onto the map, the map registers itself as
listener for the geographic location, so it can be updated when the
location changes. Furthermore, if the object dragged in allows the map
to <em>set</em> its geographic location, the map allows that object to
be directly dragged. This makes the map a piece of a larger mashup
application construction kit. For example, an application might use it
as a building block, allowing the user can drag their location around
and see all the good restaurants within walking distance of their
location. An advanced user with knowledge of scripting languages, or
with access to a graphical application builder, may be able to
construct such an application themselves.</p>
