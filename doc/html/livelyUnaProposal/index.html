<h1>Distribution in the Lively Kernel</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>We propose to evolve the Lively kernel into a system for
user-directed distributed computing. We will:</p>

<ol>

  <li><p>Incorporate the <em>Uni-Tea</em> model to allow ubiquitous
  sharing of distributed objects;</p></li>

  <li><p>Use the <em>Caja</em> capability language, which is a subset
  of JavaScript, to make this sharing secure;</p></li>

  <li><p>Define a way for our objects to interoperate, at a
  fine-grained level, with existing Web pages and Web browsing
  workflows; and</p></li>
  
  <li><p>Empower the end-user, make the system more responsive and
  live, and have a whole lot of fun.</p></li>
  
</ol>

<h2>Background</h2>

<h3>Lively</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://research.sun.com/projects/lively/">Lively
Kernel</a> is an implementation of a self-modifying, visually rich
graphical system, in the tradition of Smalltalk and Squeak, in pure
JavaScript. It runs in most Web browsers without modification, using
the browser's native SVG support for rendering. The user interface is
modeled after the Morphic GUI toolkit.</p>

<h3>Uni-Tea</h3>

<p>The <a
href="http://www.erights.org/talks/uni-tea/index.html">Uni-Tea</a>
model is a conceptual framework for distributed objects that abstracts
over most common distribution strategies. Each distributed object, or
<em>unum</em>, is represented in each address space from which it is
accessible by a local object called a <em>presence</em>:</p>

<div class="figure"><img src="unumPresence.png"/></div>

<p>The unum is the emergent behavior of all the presences acting
together. The state and code of each presence is faulted into the host
address space via a number of mechanisms, such as:</p>

<ul>

  <li><p>Bootstrapping, whereby the presence is hard-coded into a
  program to permit communication with some pre-arranged
  unum;</p></li>

  <li><p>Receiving the presence of the unum in the payload of a remote
  message; or</p></li>
  
  <li><p>Resolving an identifier via some previously agreed-upon name
  resolution mechanism. (Such a mechanism will itself likely culminate
  in receiving the presence in the payload of a remote
  message.)</p></li>

</ul>

<p>Each unum may possess references to other una. In this case, at
least one presence of the possessor unum contains a presence of the
unum referred to. In other words, una compose, and we can treat the
presence of one unum as an entry point into an entire object
graph:</p>

<div class="figure"><img src="recursivePresence.png"/></div>

<p>Each presence is responsible for implementing a protocol such that
the contract of the unum as a whole is honored. For example:</p>

<ul>

  <li><p>If the unum guarantees global serializability of all its
  operations, it might achieve this by choosing a master copy
  (presence), to which all other presences forward requests. These
  presences might, in turn, return a <a
  href="http://www.erights.org/elib/distrib/pipeline.html">promise</a>
  or <a
  href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Future.html">future</a>
  for the result of each request, to be satisfied when the resulting
  network roundtrip is complete.</p></li>

  <li><p>Another unum may reserve the right to serve queries using
  local, possibly stale data. Some presences could then serve requests
  synchronously and without a network roundtrip.</p></li>

  <li><p>Yet another unum might withhold some confidential state from
  a presence because it does not trust the environment in which the
  presence is hosted.</p></li>
  
</ul>

<h3>Caja</h3>

<p>A fine-grained capability security substrate is a necessary
component of a mobile code framework such as we are proposing.  The
Google <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-caja/">Caja</a>
project defines a fail-stop <a
href="http://google-caja.googlecode.com/files/caja-spec-2008-01-15.pdf">subset</a>
of the JavaScript language within which language level capability
security may be enforced. Caja is currently implemented by translating
("cajoling") Caja code to JavaScript, adding run-time checks where
necessary. This strategy allows Caja to run on existing JavaScript
engines and, specifically, allows us to port Lively to Caja with no
loss of ubiquitous, zero-install availability.</p>

<h2>Browser integration</h2>

<p>Given an unum which is bound to a name via some naming service, it
is possible for a Web service to construct an HTTP URL for that
unum. The default response from the URL is a Web page containing some
bootstrap JavaScript content. When this page is loaded into a browser,
it will initialize a Lively interpreter containing a presence of the
unum:</p>

<div class="figure"><img src="presenceInBrowser.png"/></div>

<p>Users can now bookmark and share references to this unum's URL
using exising Web tools. And HTML authors may now embed a presence
directly into any existing Web content using an
<code>iframe</code>:</p>

<div class="figure"><img src="presenceInIframe.png"/></div>

<p>Given the necessary JavaScript libraries available easily,
<em>e.g.</em>, in a manner that can be included as simple
<code>script</code> elements, programmers can embed an unum into an
existing Web application without having to rewrite the rest of their
application:</p>

<div class="figure"><img src="presenceInWebApp.png"/></div>

<p>In this setting, we can expose the API of the unum to the enclosing
JavaScript, allowing the two codebases to interoperate. And, since
each Lively Kernel world can be represented as just another unum,
access to a world is a simple matter of providing access to its unum
using any of the techniques mentioned previously. A useful side effect
is that Lively worlds can be shared between users, or used from
multiple sites by the same user, without any special programming:</p>

<div class="figure"><img src="worldsAsPresences.png"/></div>

<p>The <a
href="http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/">OpenSocial</a> project,
among others, is building an ecosystem of <a
href="http://code.google.com/apis/gadgets/"><em>gadgets</em></a>. A
gadget is a small JavaScript and HTML application which may be hosted
in a third party Web page <em>container</em>:</p>

<div class="figure"><img src="gadgetsPage.png"/></div>

<p>A gadget is known by the URL to its <em>gadget spec</em>, which is

<pre name="code" class="xml:nocontrols">
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;Module&gt;
&lt;ModulePrefs title="hello world example"/&gt;
&lt;Content type="html"&gt;&lt;![CDATA[
  &lt;h1&gt;Hello world!&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;div id="foo"/&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;
    document.getElementById('foo').innerHTML = 'Hello folks';
  &lt;/script&gt;
]]&gt;&lt;/Content&gt;
&lt;/Module&gt;
</pre>

<p>Note that the area inside the <code>Content</code> tag is
essentially a Web page fragment, containing scripts and literal
content. Similarly to the manner in which we hosted an unum as a Web
page, we could host it as a gadget spec, building its content
dynamically; thus a gadget spec URL like
<code>http://abowman.googlepages.com/penguins.xml</code> which, from
the point of view of OpenSocial, is the analogue of a "class" or an
"application", would in our case represent a specific unum
<em>instance</em> implemented by shipping mobile code, composed on the
fly as needed, to the client.</p>

<p>To accomplish this, we would need to ensure that the gadget
container provides enough authority to the gadget thus instantiated,
to allow the contained unum to run its protocols.</p>

<h2>Identifier conversions</h2>

<p>We would like to support clipboard operations (drag and drop, and
copy and paste) applied to the identity of an unum. In so doing, we
will need to translate its identifier to pass through clipboard
channels that are unaware of Lively una. We will need to consider at
least the following cases:</p>

<div class="figure"><img src="dragAndDropCases.png"/></div>

<h3>(1) Within one world</h3>

<p>Transfer within the same world is trivial. Since we have full
access to the same JavaScript context, we can share direct object
references.</p>

<h3>(2) Between two worlds</h3>

<p>Two worlds running in separate JavaScript contexts must exchange
unum identifiers using some mechanism that the native environment can
support. We need to investigate drag and drop between separate browser
windows. Can we override platform copy-paste behavior from JavaScript
so that it seems to work (<em>e.g.</em>, &#x2318;-C and &#x2318;-V on
the Mac; Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V on a PC).</div>

<h3>(3) World to native bookmarks</h3>

<p>When we copy an unum's identity to a native bookmarks context
expecting an HTTP URL, we can transorm the identity to a URL that
wraps the unum in a Web page with a JavaScript shim, as discussed
earlier. We would also have to intercept the clipboard events so that
the URL is transferred properly. If an unum is "hosted" by some remote
server, it can negotiate with its server for a suitable URL. In the
general case, however, <em>e.g.</em> if an unum is materialized purely
by the collaboration of equal peers, it is not clear how such a URL
would be generated.</p>

<h3>(4) Native bookmarks to world</h3>

<p>When we copy a URL from a native bookmarks context to a world, we
need to "unwrap" the URL to obtain a native representation of the
unum's identity. This is actually a hard problem because we assume
that each unum could have a different way of doing the forward
encoding, from its identity into a URL. A solution could be to require
each unum's URL to respond to some special HTTP request, which would
return the unum's identity in a more native form.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>

<p>We may simplify interoperability betwen a bookmarks context and
Lively by defining a standard (though pehaps optional) "hosted unum"
protocol allowing uniform access from either a plain browser,
returning a container Web page with JavaScript shims containing a
presence, or from within a Lively application, returning information
that would directly instantiate a presence of the unum.</p>

<p>One complication is that the JavaScript shims which make una
accessible from Web pages run with full authority in JavaScript,
making them part of the user's <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_computing_base">trusted
computing base (TCB)</a>. This is not acceptable if the Web service
that generates the shims is in a different trust domain from some of
the una that are (recursively) embedded in the resulting presence. We
can solve this in a quasi-centralized fashion if we define two
orthogonal components:</p>

<ol>

  <li><p>An internal Lively unum protocol, that always uses Caja and
  enforces object capability rules; and</p></li>

  <li><p>A protocol for secular Web gateways that translate from
  Lively unum references to HTTP Web pages and back.</p></li>

</ol>

<p>A user could then choose a trusted gateway, implicitly adding that
to their TCB; individual una would not be able to choose the gateway
on behalf of the user. This leaves open an attack vector where a user
shares an unum URL (using the native clipboard) with another user,
where the shared URL points to a compromised Lively gateway.</p>

<h2>Models and views</h2>

<p>The unum model does not require a model/view separation (though
that may be useful for other purposes). Specifically, a presence of an
unum may be a Morph. For the right implementation of the platform's
GUI library, the presence will come to acquire pointers to native GUI
objects (such as SVG DOM nodes) as a natural consequence of being
unmarshaled at a destination and added to a scene graph.</p>

<p>Being able to make distributed references to Morphs is useful, but
we must still solve some conceptual problems:</p>

<ul>

  <li><p>If a user drags and drops a Morph displaying some document
  into a target, are they gesturing with the Morph, or with some
  underlying "model object" representing the document's
  implementation?</p></li>

  <li><p>If we respond to the previous question by building a scheme
  whereby (some) Morph gestures always refer to the underlying
  "model", how do we recover the utility of gesturing using the Morph
  itself (<em>e.g.</em>, to construct a compound view) without
  confusing a user with too many affordances?</p></li>

  <li><p>How may we build a principled yet usable framework that
  permits multiple views of an object (<em>e.g.</em>, an "Outline" and
  "Presentation" view of a document)? Can, or should, this framework
  permit third parties to provide view Morphs for common data
  types?</p></li>
  
</ul>

<h2>Local persistence</h2>

<p>Initiatives such as the Google Gears <a
href="http://code.google.com/apis/gears/api_database.html">Database</a>,
Dojo <a href="http://dojotoolkit.org/node/115">Storage</a>, and HTML5
<a
href="http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/#storage">persistent
storage</a> provide native persistence in the browser. This allows
applications to continue to work offline, and cache their data for
better performance.</p>

<p>Using these advances to build Web applications that cache their
state correctly is still very hard. The unum model is a step in the
right direction, providing an abstraction -- and possible hooks for a
framework -- where remote objects can cache their code and data and
synchronize with servers.</p>

<h2>Class evolution</h2>

<p>JavaScript class patterns rely on the use of the
<code>prototype</code> property of an object. This mechanism is both
too powerful and not powerful enough:</p>

<ul>

  <li><p><strong>Too powerful</strong> &mdash; Anyone with access to a
  function can change its <code>prototype</code> property, and
  therefore the entire class hierarchy created when that function is
  used with <code>new</code> to construct objects, and anyone with
  access to an object's internal <code><em>[[prototype]]</em></code>
  object can change its behavior at will by replacing properties.  By
  allowing any external client to change its class structure at will,
  an object's invariants are at risk, and the result of
  <code>instanceof</code> is not a stable predictor of an object's
  progeny. </p></li>

  <li><p><strong>Not powerful enough</strong> &mdash; The
  <code><em>[[prototype]]</em></code> of an object is fixed at
  construction time so, in contrast with all the mutability elsewhere,
  this aspect of the object remains strangely rigid.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>For a secure runtime, we need strong encapsulation and
invariants. For long term orthogonal persistence, we need to change
the static aspects (typically, the code) of live objects from within
the system. We reconcile these goals via a two step process.</p>

<h3>Cajita: simple, safe encapsulation</h3>

<p>We recommend that Lively adopt <em>Cajita</em>, which is
essentially the JavaScript language without <code>this</code>,
<code>new</code> or the use of <code>prototype</code>s -- essentially
an object oriented Scheme. An example of a constructor for a class
<code>Point</code> in Cajita looks like the following:</p>

<pre name="code" class="js:nocontrols">
function makePoint(x, y) {
  return caja.freeze({
    getX: function() { return x; }
    getY: function() { return y; }
    toString: function() { return "(" + x + "," + y + ")"; }
  });
}
</pre>

<p>All objects are closures with a simple structure; inheritance is
accomplished by chaining initializers prior to <code>freeze</code>ing
the result.</p>

<p>We believe that, for <em>de novo</em> code, Cajita presents the
best fit for a simple, orthogonal capability language within
JavaScript.  Its "everything is an object" model contrasts with the
commonly accepted JavaScript practice of simulating the "import" of a
large number of names (<em>e.g.</em>, "classes") into the global
namespace and using them as static references, even though they are
actually first-class, mutable objects. Cajita works well for building
small modules of mobile code that are loaded in isolation, since
Cajita programs work the same way independently of whether some
external functionality is provided as an explicit parameter or
"imported" via some mechanism.</p>

<p>Consider a Cajita program that returns a random point. It could be
coded as a function that takes a <code>Math</code> module as an
explicit parameter:</p>

<pre name="code" class="js:nocontrols">
function makeRandomPoint(math) {
  return makePoint(math.random(), math.random());
}
</pre>

<p>or it could be given a capability to import modules:</p>

<pre name="code" class="js:nocontrols">
function makeRandomPoint(importer) {
  var math = importer.import("Math");
  return makePoint(math.random(), math.random());
}
</pre>

<p>but in either case, everything is a direct object reference. The alternative
in Java might look like:</p>

<pre name="code" class="java:nocontrols">
import java.lang.Math;
public class RandomPoint {
  public static String makeRandomPoint() {
    return new Point(Math.random(), Math.random());
  }
}
</pre>

<p>where the reference to <code>import</code> is effectively a call to
the classloader mechanism to import the code. This call is, however,
"out of band" from the viewpoint of the code; it is not an explicit
message to any object, and it does not return a first class object, so
its behavior cannot easily be customized from within the language (and
the customary classloader histrionics do <em>not</em> qualify).</p>

<h3>Classes as refactories</h3>

<p>To recover the generalizations possible with a class-like system,
we present a pattern where a class is used in a role we refer to as a
<em>refactory</em>. An object constructed using this pattern has the
following structure:</p>

<div class="figure"><img src="refactoryPattern.png"/></div>

<ul>

  <li><p><strong>proxy</strong> &mdash; hosts the public interface of
  the object as a whole, and forwards requests to the
  implementation. Maintains a reference to the class. The code for the
  proxy is provided as a bootstrap service by the platform, and does
  not participate in code evolution.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>implementation</strong> &mdash; implements the
  functionality of the object.</p></li>

  <li><p><strong>class</strong> &mdash; responsible for having
  constructed the proxy and implementation in the first place,
  supplying the proxy with a pointer to itself.</p></li>

</ul>

<p>The class serves as a factory for new instances, where the class
constructs and returns the entire structure above. When the contents
of the class change (e.g., if the class is locally edited, or if it is
itself an unum), the proxy can be notified (e.g., it can subscribe to
change messages from the class). At that point, it can send the
<code>refactor</code> message to the class:</p>

<pre name="code" class="js:nocontrols">
myImplementation = myClass.refactor(myImplementation);
</pre>

<p>The result will be a new implementation object, containing as much
as possible of the data in the previous implementation, but with
static state as specified by the new class.</p>

<p>This scheme can be accomplished by <em>computational
refraction</em>, as described in <a
