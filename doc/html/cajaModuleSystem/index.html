<h1>Caja Module System</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This document describes the manner in which Caja code is composed
at run-time.</p>

<h2>Overview of Cajoling</h2>

<p>Caja code is JavaScript code that conforms to the fail-stop subset
of JavaScript defined by the Caja specification. A conforming Caja
system <em>cajoles</em> a Caja input program, producing as output a
Caja <em>module</em>. A Caja module is a unit of JavaScript code with
the following well-known top-level structure:</p>

<pre>
___.loadModule(function(___IMPORTS___) {
  <em>... translated code here ...</em>
});
</pre>

<p>The anonymous function defined by this stereotypical structure is
called the <em>module function</em>.</p>

<h2>Module instantiation</h2>

<p>Caja modules run within a <em>container</em> which acts as an OS
kernel. Part or all of the container is written in native JavaScript
and runs with full authority.</p>

<p>A Caja container <em>instantiates</em> a module by calling its
module function. By design, the module function cannot save state
between invocations, so that each instance of a module is an isolate.
Module instances may only communicate with the outside world as
arranged by their container.</p>

<p>A Caja container instantiates modules as part of a boot-up process,
as a result of some configuration, or at the behest of other
modules.</p>

<h2>Free variables</h2>

<p>The <em>free variables</em> of a block of Caja code are the
variables which are not explicitly declared in the scope chain
enclosing their point of use. For example, in the following:</p>

<pre>
var x = 0;
y.foo = 3;
function() {
  z.bar = 4;
}
</pre>

<p>The variables <code>y</code> and <code>z</code>, but not
<code>x</code>, are free variables.</p>

<h2>Imports lists</h2>

<p>The <code>___IMPORTS___</code> parameter to the module function is
called the module's <em>imports list</em>. It is an object the
properties of which are the capabilities provided to the module by the
container.</p>

<p>The free variables of a Caja block are rewritten to be references
to its imports list. For example, the reference to <code>y</code> in
the previous example would be rewritten as follows (highly simplified
for clarity):</p>

<pre>
___IMPORTS___.y.foo = 3;
</pre>

<p>Caja code is rewritten such that referring to a non-existent member
of the imports list throws a <code>ReferenceError</code>. This mimics
the behavior of references to undefined variables in the global scope
of a JavaScript program.</p>

<h2>Pre-defined imports</h2>

<p>Some members of the imports list of a module are present without
the module's code having to make any special effort.</p>

<h3>Built-in objects</h3>

<p>The JavaScript built-in objects such as <code>Object</code> and
<code>Array</code> must be provided to each module, as listed in
Section 4.2 of Ecma-262 and restricted in semantics and availability
by the Caja specification.</p>

<h3>Caja entry points</h3>

<p>Two Caja entry points are provided for each module.
<code>caja</code> refers to a powerless helper object implementing
that part of the Caja microkernel that is directly visible to the
programmer. <code>modules</code> is an object allowing the program to
modify its imports list and provide objects for the imports lists of
other modules.</p>

<h3>Application specific objects</h3>

<p>Container implementations may choose to add more default objects to
the imports lists of modules they host. For example, a container used
for Web content may define a <code>document</code> serving as a secure
alternative to the eponymous object provided by Web browsers.</p>

<h2>The <code>modules</code> object</h2>

<p>The <code>modules</code> object is the visible entry point into the
module system.</p>

<h3><code>modules.import(url)</code></h3>

<p>Instantiates the named module and loads its exported symbols into
this module's imports list.</p>

<p><code>url</code> &mdash; the URL of a module.</p>

<p><strong>returns</strong> a truthy value on success, or a falsy
value on failure.</p>

<pre>
try {
  foo.doSomething(3, 4);
} catch (e) {
  // ReferenceError since 'foo' not defined
}

// The following module exports 'foo'
modules.import('http://example.com/aModule.js');

// Now the following will succeed
foo.doSomething(3, 4);
</pre>

<h3><code>modules.importValue(url)</code></h3>

<p>Similar to <code>modules.import</code>, but returns the module's
symbols as the properties of an object.</p>

<p><code>url</code> &mdash; the URL of a module.</p>

<p><strong>returns</strong> an object the properties of which are the
symbols exported by the module being loaded.</p>

<pre>
var exm = modules.importValue('http://example.com/aModule.js');
exm.foo.doSomething(3, 4);
</pre>

<h3><code>modules.export(name, value)</code></h3>

<p>Export a symbol to the container or to a module that is
instantiating this module.</p>

<p><code>name</code> &mdash; the name under which to export an
object.</p>

<p><code>value</code> &mdash; an object being exported.</p>

<p><strong>returns</strong> a truthy value on success, or a falsy
value on failure.</p>

<pre>
function aFunc(x, y) { return x + y; }

modules.export('foo', aFunc);
modules.export('bar', caja.freeze({ baz: 4 }));
</pre>
