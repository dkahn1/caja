<div class="title">Caja Module System</div>

<h1>Problem statement</h1>

<p>We need to design a mechanism for secure code sharing in Caja. Caja
as currently specified allows any third party to implement such a
mechanism but, in order to guide container developers and ensure that
common mistakes are avoided, we at least need to build an example of a
good solution.</p>

<h1>Background</h1>

<h2>Current JavaScript practice</h2>

<p>Current JavaScript code (as embedded in HTML pages) composes code
by loading scripts, in either of two ways.</p>

<h3>Direct inclusion</h3>

<p>Web pages include code from external URIs via
<code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags with a <code>src</code>
attribute:</p>

<pre>
&lt;script
    type="text/javascript"
    src="http://example.com/foo.js"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  <em>At this point, definitions from "foo.js" are in the global
  namespace and can be used directly.</em>
&lt;/script&gt;</pre>

<h3>Run-time loading</h3>

<p>A number of JavaScript libraries provide a layer on top of this by
providing a module loader:</p>

<pre>
&lt;script
    type="text/javascript"
    src="http://www.google.com/jsapi?key=ABCDEFG"&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
  <em>At this point, the object "google" is in the global namespace.</em>

  google.load("maps", "2");    
  <em>At this point, "maps" is in the global namespace.</em>
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<p>Such libraries take advantage of the fact that, in JavaScript, the
properties of the global symbol <code>this</code> are the bindings in
the global lexical scope, and manipulating the global
<code>this</code> is immediately reflected in the global lexical
scope.</p>

<h2>Current Caja practice</h2>

<p>If <code>&lt;script src="..."&gt;</code> tags are found in Caja
code, the contents at the <code>src</code> URI are fetched and
transcluded into the Caja input, roughly as though the
<code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag contained the code in-line and had no
<code>src</code> attribute. The result is then Cajoled as a unit. A
module is therefore "statically linked" with all its external
dependencies. This practice fails to scale for a number of
reasons:</p>

<ol>

  <li><p>Each external script has access to the global lexical scope
  of the including module, yet the author of the including module may
  not have strict control over the external script. This essentially
  breaks intra-module isolation.</p></li>

  <li><p>Consider two modules that share instances of, say,
  <code>Widget</code> objects created by a presumably common widget
  library. If the modules, when cajoled, transcluded different
  versions of the widget library, they may uknowingly violate each
  others' integrity (e.g., since the <code>Widget</code> interface may
  have changed between versions).</p></li>
  
  <li><p>JavaScript is a dynamic language. We lose expressive power if
  we fail to allow JavaScript programmers to load code on demand.</p></li>
  
  <li><p>For commonly used code, the "static linking" creates
  code bloat we would like to avoid.</p></li>

</ol>

<h1>Definitions</h1>

<p>A <strong>module</strong> is a unit of cajoled Caja code
represented as a module function. <strong>Instantiation</strong> is
the process of calling a module function, resulting in some set of
objects that collectively represent a <strong>module instance</strong>
(or just <strong>instance</strong>). The entity that instantiates a
module is called that module's <strong>parent</strong>, and the
instantiated module is called the <strong>child</strong> of the
instantiating entity.</p>

<h1>Requirements</h1>

<h2>Mandatory items</h2>

<h3>Caja module is smallest unit</h3>

<p>The unit of code distribution and sharing must be no smaller than
one Caja module. We understand the security and isolation properties
of a Caja module, and would like to re-use our understanding.</p>

<h3>Larger units composed from Caja modules</h3>

<p>If the module system introduces a larger abstraction than an
individual Caja module, it must be understandable in terms of the
collective behavior of isolated Caja modules.</p>

<p>Specifically, it is not allowable to create compositions from parts
of the internals of existing modules.</p>

<h3>Module privacy is respected</h3>

<p>Under no circumstances may any component, including the module
system or container, rely on introspecting on the internal code or
state within a Caja module's isolation boundary.</p>

<h3>System may instantiate modules</h3>

<p>Privileged code belonging to the TCB &mdash; i.e., the container or
module system &mdash; may instantiate modules.</p>

<h3>Instances may instantiate modules</h3>

<p>An instance may instantiate other modules. (This ability may be
attenuated, but it must not be systemically impossible.)</p>

<h3>Instances are isolated</h3>

<p>Instances, including multiple instantiations of the same module
code, must be isolated from one another. By design, Caja allows two
modules to share an imported capability, but the module system itself
should open no other conduits of causality, or explicit communication
channels, between any two module instances.</p>

<h3>Imports and module instantiation under parent control</h3>

<p>The parent of a module must exert full positive control over:</p>

<ul>

  <li><p>The contents of the <code>IMPORTS___</code> of the
  child.</p></li>

  <li><p>The set of modules that the child is itself permitted to
  instantiate.</p></li>

</ul>

<h3>Exported value(s) are possible</h3>

<p>A module may export object references to its parent.</p>

<h3>Export under module control</h3>

<p>A module must exert full positive control over the set of
capabilities it exports to its parent.</p>

<h3>Module loading does not break isolation</h3>

<p>The ability to load modules must not open a conduit of causality to
the outside world. For example, a module instance must not be able to
mount a wall-banging attack by loading certain modules in a given
order.</p>

<div class="note">Perhaps this item should be reworded to say that it
should be merely <em>possible</em> for the invoking entity to enforce
this isolation.</div>

<h2>Desiderata</h2>

<h3>&mu;kernel architecture</h3>

<p>It should be possible to build a &mu;kernel implementation using
the module system. We envision this would entail a small bootloader
JavaScript fragment that loads the TCB (e.g., <code>caja.js</code>)
then loads some primordial modules, supplying them with powerful
capabilities that they attenuate and distribute to their children.</p>

<h3>Module identity</h3>

<p>Our solution should support a usage pattern where, within some
well-defined realm, loading a module using the same request criteria
should result in the identical cajoled code being instantiated.
For example, within some realm, calling:</p>

<pre>
loadModule('goog.maps', '3.17', 'ABCDEFGH');
</pre>

<p>would result in the same module code being instantiated.</p>

<div class="note">Do we want to explicitly fix, as a matter of spec
compliance, what constitutes a "realm" in this criterion? A page? A
frame? A Gears Worker?</div>

<div class="note">Should the Caja framework <em>impose</em> this
requirement on any user-supplied implementation parts of the module
system, or is that merely a recommendation to whomever chooses to
implement parts of the module system? This depends, among other
things, on the semantics of the module loading API "request criteria".
Do we standardize on some format for these so we can enforce
identity?</div>

<h1>Strawman proposal</h1>

<p>The following is a fragmentary strawman proposal to serve as a
starting point for discussion. The material discussed in this section
is definitely <em>not</em> normative.</p>

<h2>Module API</h2>

<p>By convention, the <code>IMPORTS___</code> of any module contains a
reserved name <code>loader</code> that allows the module to interact
with the module system.</p>

<h3><code>loader.load</code></h3>

<pre>
loader.load(criteria, importsOpt);
</pre>

<p>Instantiates the module identified by <code>criteria</code>. The
<code>criteria</code> are a JSON container of arbitrary structure
describing the module to be loaded. The <code>importsOpt</code> is an
optional parameter containing an object literal the public properties
of which will be used as entries in the <code>IMPORTS___</code> of the
child module. The return value of this function is the return value of
the child module (see below). For example:</p>

<pre>
var myCanvas = /* ... */;
var myWidget = loader.load({
  name: 'widget',
  version: { range: ['3.7', '3.9'] },
}, {
  canvas: myCanvas
});
</pre>

<div class="note">What about boilerplate <code>IMPORTS___</code> like
<code>Object</code> and <code>Date</code>? We certainly don't want the
parent module to supply these explicitly, <em>every</em> time, now do
we? That would be very verbose.</div>

<h3><code>loader.return</code></h3>

<pre>
loader.return(aValue);
</pre>

<p>Returns <code>aValue</code> as the return value of this module
instance. In the case of multiple calls to <code>return</code>, the
value supplied to the last call is used. For example:</p>

<pre>
var theWidget = constructWidget(canvas, defaultResolution);
theWidget.initialize();
loader.return(theWidget);
</pre>

</body>

</html>
